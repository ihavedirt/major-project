# Major Project Proposal
For my major project I would like to continue my beat making program. Essentially it will be a basic program to make music using beats and melody from built in keyboard. I already made a program to create bars of beats. Hopfully I will be able to copy the 2D array and put those into the music sheet array. for the keyboard I hope to use keyboard inputs to add notes into another bar for melodies.

## Need to Have List
- bar sheet to make basic beat
- ability to play beats
- ability to play overall music sheet
- making multiple patterns
- making multiple melody patterns
- add bars to music sheet

## Nice to Have List
- instrument lables
- pattern labels
- visual audio graph
- ability to save
- piano keyboard(about 2 octaves)
