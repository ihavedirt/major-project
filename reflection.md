# reflection:
throughtout the project I encountered a few problems. 



-didnt know how to make the visuals for the graph better and more optimal, used two for loops inside a nested for loop to create a pattern. while
i could have used transparent rectangles behind it, i totally forgot about that. another problem with this was that after changin the value in the array
(after clicking it), it would not return to the same colour pattern. So i just used modular devision.
-tried to use a map to scroll through the bar patterns, instead used an array. another problem i faced with this was that everytime the user saved the 
pattern, it wouldnt make a new pattern, it would instead maintain all changes that were applied to the original array. inorder to fix this, i simply used
the slice function.
